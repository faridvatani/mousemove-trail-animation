The Mousemove Trail Animation project is a web-based visual effect that generates a series of div elements following the mouse cursor, creating a dynamic trail animation. This effect is achieved through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with divs being added and removed in response to mouse movements to simulate the trail.
